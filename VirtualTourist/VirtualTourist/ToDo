Fix
# Download random images
# New collection should get new images
# Maybe get rid of number of images per page, or at least increase it.
# Fix issues mentioned in the udacity comment
  - Change use of sync method to get the link to the image. NSData(contentsOfUrl: imageURL)-- https://discussions.udacity.com/t/virtual-tourist-cannot-get-collection-view-to-show-images/159154/2
  - memory leak wrt creating a new controller each time

Todo
# Clicking on photo should delete it
# Collection should move up to fill the view when the photo is deleted
# Persistence
# Show placeholder for each image while it is being downloaded -- implement this after persistence

Questions
# Ask question on placeholder image?
# Ask question on what to do if there are 100s of pictures.

Mapping
# FavoriteActorViewController == MapViewController
# ActorPickedViewController == Dropping a pin (so... still the MapViewController)
# MovieListViewController = CollectionViewController

# NSFetchedResultsController can be used to manage changes to a UICollectionView using the ColorCollection example. It is typically meant for tables.
# Person == Location
# Movie == Photo
# Copy configureCell from MovieListViewController to CollectionViewController.
